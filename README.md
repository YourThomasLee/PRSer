## About the theme of this Repo
  The theme of this repo focused on is my research about Rough Sets(or rather, filter feature selection method for discrete data based on Rough sets, classification rules generating in Rough Sets. Rough sets theory is one of effective tools to imprecise, incomplete, uncertainty information processing)
